            "passage": "“I have longed to make the acquaintance of a ‘modern girl,’ that proud, independent girl who has all my sympathy! I do not belong to the Indian world, but to that of my sisters who are struggling forward in the distant West. If the laws of my land permitted it, I would be like the new woman in Europe; but age-long traditions that cannot be broken hold us back. Someday those traditions will loosen and let us go, but it may be three, four generations after us. Oh, you do not know what it is to love this young, new age with heart and soul, and yet to be bound hand and foot, chained by all the laws, customs, and conventions of one’s land. All our institutions are directly opposed to the progress for which I so long for the sake of our people. Day and night I wonder by what means our ancient traditions could be overcome. But it was not the voices alone which reached me from that distant, bright, new-born Europe, which made me long for a change in existing conditions for women. Even in my childhood, the word ‘emancipation’ enchanted my ears and awakened in me an ever-growing longing for freedom and independence—a longing to stand alone.”",

            "passage": "“We often see articles in our [Brazilian] newspapers trying to convince the reader that slavery among us is a very mild and pleasant condition for the slave—so often, in fact, that one may almost begin to believe that, if slaves were asked, they would prefer slavery to freedom. This only proves that newspaper articles are not written by slaves. . . .The legal position of slaves in Brazil can be summed up in these words: the Constitution does not apply to them. Our [1824] Constitution is full of lofty ideas [such as]: ‘No citizen can be forced to do anything except as required by law;’ ‘The law shall apply equally to every person;’ ‘Whipping, torture, and all other cruel punishments are abolished,’ etc. Yet, in this ostensibly free nation . . . we must have, on a daily basis, judges, police, and, if need be, the army and navy employed to force enslaved men, women, and children to work night and day without any compensation. To admit this in the highest law of the land would reduce the list of Brazilian freedoms to a transparent fraud. For this reason the Constitution does not even mention slaves or attempt to regulate their status.”",

            "passage": "“By the end of the nineteenth century, Germany had advanced beyond Britain in terms of economic output. The prime reason for this development was that Germany developed newer industries, while Britain continued to stress textile production. Formerly an agricultural country, the German Empire has come to be regarded as one of the leading industrial nations of the world and, in the chemical industries, Germany has for some time occupied a leading place. One of the most successful chemical and pharmaceutical firms in Germany is the Bayer company. Bayer employs 3,500 people alone at its plant in Leverkusen, and the factory is so gigantic that all of these people are barely noticed when a visitor tours it. The laboratories are arranged very much in the same manner as the university laboratories in Britain. Each workstation receives a supply of electricity, compressed air, steam, and hot and cold water. The research chemists are paid a salary of about 100 British pounds for the first year. If a chemist has shown himself to be useful in his first year, he may receive a longer contract and may receive royalties on any processes that he invented.”",
